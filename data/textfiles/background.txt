A little about me: Even before completing my undergraduate degree, I began my journey at Tecnotree as a software 
developer. I excelled during my internship which earned me a full-time role as a web application developer. Being new to 
the corporate world, I had to quickly learn new technologies, which I did during my off-hours and immediately applied to 
my work. During this time, I also freelanced as a frontend developer for a startup called Credental, collaborating directly 
with the founders in Lehi, Utah. Managing two roles while learning and applying new skills was challenging, but it helped 
me discover my potential and develop a strong interest in software development, ultimately leading to my decision to move 
abroad. I was once a person unsure about my future, but becoming a software developer gave me direction. I moved to the 
US because many of the world’s leading products and teams are here, and I genuinely want to work with and learn from 
them. Currently, I’m juggling coursework, part-time jobs, and my job search. That’s why you’ll notice I’ve taken on multiple 
roles in my resume. Now, I’m looking for an opportunity where I want to put all my focus and can strengthen my software 
development skills and contribute meaningfully to Postman. I still haven’t had the kind of opportunity I moved to the US 
for, and with my clear focus and genuine passion, I believe I can be a valuable addition to your team and the company.
