I evaluated machine learning models for mask detection, achieving 90% accuracy with VGG19 and 80% with MobileNetV2 and ResNet50. Additionally, I implemented the MaskTheFace script to detect facial features and apply masks to images, generating multiple variations for improved training data. This project was created during the pandemic to address the increased prevalence of mask-wearing.",

Drawing on participatory design principles and insights from interviews with stakeholders, TODO is envisioned as a dynamic, interactive, and emotionally intelligent robot. The research focuses on two primary factors that influence the robot’s effectiveness: its personality and conversational timing. By examining how these traits shape user perceptions, the study seeks to understand the role of politeness and engagement in fostering productive human-robot interactions. Using iterative design processes, grounded theory analysis, and controlled experiments, this research lays the groundwork for developing socially responsive robots that can assist teachers and enhance the learning experience for young students.",

      "description": "Crack detection in construction materials is essential for ensuring structural safety and minimizing maintenance cost. Traditionally, methods such as manual inspection are time taking and have a room for human error thus often require specialized tools. This project proposes a machine learning based approach using Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) to detect cracks in concrete surfaces through image analysis. Concrete was chosen as the initial materia due its widespread use. A dataset of 2GB containing labeled images of cracked and non cracked concrete was used which incorporated only real samples. The results suggest that deep learning models can effectively automate crack detection, offering a scalable alternative to manual methods.",

By intentionally violating usability, accessibility, and visual hierarchy across multiple screens, the project highlights the real impact of bad interaction design.

The core gameplay revolves around strategic tower placement, where each tower and enemy belongs to a rock, paper, or scissors variant, and their effectiveness changes based on classic RPS rules. Enemies spawn in waves along a fixed path, giving players time between waves to place, upgrade, and manage defenses. The game features a clean HUD displaying player health, score, inventory, and in-game store, along with sound effects for key actions to enhance feedback. While the initial scope included multiple maps and a large variety of towers and enemies, the final implementation focused on a polished experience with 3 towers, 3 enemy types, and 1 map, emphasizing balanced mechanics, clear design, and engaging wave-based progression.",

  "aboutpara": "#OpentoWork\n I’m a Software Engineer who loves building clean, fast, and user-friendly web and mobile applications. I’ve worked across frontend, backend, and full-stack development, and enjoy improving both performance and user experience. \n\nMost recently, I worked as a Frontend Software Engineer Intern at Zinnia, where I developed a new section called “Usage” in the app. I was the sole frontend representative in meetings with the product manager, backend, and UX team, gathering requirements, assessing feasibility, estimating timelines, and coordinating implementation details. I also led a team of interns to design an on-time delivery metrics system, managing requirements, creating JIRA tasks, and ensuring timely delivery. This experience strengthened my skills as both a developer and a leader. Take a look at my accomplishments at this role and comments from my teammates using this link - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BMIozehPXhRWKFtqaDG2-YaOyRSYhkYGnkzihC0ZgEE/edit?tab=t.0\n\nBefore that, I worked as a Graduate Scientific Programmer at the Payne Institute, where I was the sole developer responsible for designing, developing, testing, and deploying a full-stack application. I built map layers using geospatial data fetched from a PostgreSQL database, improved the UI for a better user experience and the code for enhanced performance, and integrated LangChain and Gemini to analyze satellite images.\n\nEarlier, I worked at Tecnotree for over two years, where I started as an intern and grew into a Senior Developer. I developed key features for telecom web and mobile apps, implemented GraphQL APIs, added automation testing, and helped improve navigation and usability for users across several countries.\n\nI also worked with Credental, a Utah-based startup, where I owned the complete frontend using ReactJS and Typescript, integrated APIs, and designed and developed the UI for smoother collaboration between dentists and insurance providers.\n\nI enjoy working on React, Next, FastAPI, Flask, NodeJS, TypeScript, Docker, and AI-integrated applications, and I’m excited to keep building scalable, real-world solutions that make products faster, smarter, and easier to use. My goal is to keep growing as a Software Engineer who solves real world problems with software solutions.",
