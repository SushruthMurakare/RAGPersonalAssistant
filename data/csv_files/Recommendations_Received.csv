Shivam ,Prajapati,Tecnotree Corporation,Lead Developer,"I met Sushruth, when he joined my team as GET (Graduate Engineer Trainee). It was his first job too. As usual, we started with the KT sessions and started giving him less effort tickets.  It was very soon that he started understanding the features by himself and with little intervention. And we were very sure that he would be a great asset to the team.  And yes we were right. He turned out to be a great asset to the team. Every passing sprint, he was writing more mature code, he was handling bigger features and debugging bugs by himself.  So yes I can surely recommend him for his fast learner capabilities, handling work professionally and maintaining team spirit.","08/11/25, 05:24 PM",VISIBLE
Chris,Elvidge,Colorado School of Mines,Director of the Earth Observation Group,"Greetings,   Sushruth Murakare was a student worker in my computer laboratory at the Colorado School of Mines for about one year.  He reworked our web-map service, integrated new data sets, and made substantial improvements in the functionality.  We were sorry that our funding situation did not make it possible for him to stay on with us.  He is a very talented scientific programmer and he has my highest recommendation.    Sincerely,  Christopher D. Elvidge Ph.D. Director of the Earth Observation Group Payne Institute for Public Policy Colorado School of Mines","08/11/25, 04:45 PM",VISIBLE
Ed,Sztukowski,Zinnia,Senior Software Engineer,"Sushruth joined our team as an intern in the summer of 2025 and made an immediate impact. With little direction, he jumped into new feature development, and eventually drove feature work on a major section of our application.   His willingness to pick up difficult tasks and finish them in timely and clever ways made his time with us so great. Beyond his expertise with React, he was a great member of the team as well, very friendly, and humble in his approach to development. Any team would be lucky to work with Sushruth!","08/08/25, 09:04 PM",VISIBLE
